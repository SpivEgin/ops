Ops: Build dev environment with Vagrant & Ansible
=================================================

Steps to get your environment up:

1. clone this repo
2. use vagrant with virtualbox provider to get your VM up
3. use ansible for VM provisioning

## Vagrant : Create a Virtual Machine

### Install Vagrant

All you need is installing [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation).

### Run a Virtual Machine

Vagrant configuration (for virtualbox provider only) is present in the Vagrantfile, in the repository root.

Create and up a VM from a simple command:

```
vagrant up [golang,ci,weblemp,weblamp,docker]
```

## Ansible: Virtual Machine provisioning

### Install ansible

The first step is to get ansible, i'd recomand to [get it from the source](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#running-from-source) to be compatible with all the roles in the different playboks (ansible >= 2.2 required).

### Install roles from Ansible Galaxy

Install roles into the roles directory:

```
# install all roles from the requirements file to the playbooks/roles directory
cd playbooks/requirements
ansible-galaxy install -r all.yml -p ../roles
```

Alternatively, you can install only the desired roles from other requirements files:

```
# install only roles needed for the base playbook
cd playbooks/requirements
ansible-galaxy install -r base.yml -p ../roles
```

### Run a playbook

Example #1: run the base playbook on all servers listed in playbooks/inventory/local file

```
cd playbooks
ansible-playbook -i inventories/local base.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Note: don't forget to replace variables values from group_vars and host_vars, and replace encrypted values in playbooks/group_vars/all/vault.yml with yours.

Example #2: run the webservers playbook against VM listed into the webservers group of the inventory

```
cd playbooks
ansible-playbook -i inventories/local webservers.yml --limit webservers --ask-vault-pass
```
